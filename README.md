# Logging
A library meant for smarter logging.

But what is smarter logging? 
In my opinion, it means to log more, by logging less, in a format that can be programmatically searched.

The most common problem in typical logging is that too much useless information is logged,
and the useful information can't help with much all by itself, oftentimes not enough
context/metadata is included.
